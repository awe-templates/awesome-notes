## ⚙️ Vite

**[Vite](https://vite.dev/)** is a build tool that aims to provide a **faster** and leaner development experience for **modern** web projects. If there is no any bottleneck in your project, Vite is the best choice for starter templates.

## ⚙️ SWC

[SWC](https://swc.rs/) is a super-fast **JavaScript/TypeScript** compiler written in **Rust**. It's a faster alternative to Babel and TypeScript compiler. Also, we can use SWC with Vite to speed up the development process.

Supported tools:

- [WASM](https://swc.rs/docs/usage/wasm)
- [React](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc)

> Currently, SWC is not supported by Vue. See issue [#12356](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/12356).
