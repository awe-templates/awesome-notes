# 🧬 Libraries

## 📦 Package Manager

### 📍 PNPM

**[PNPM](https://pnpm.io/)** is a fast, disk space efficient package manager. It's a great alternative to NPM and Yarn. PNPM uses a **[content-addressable](https://pnpm.io/motivation)** store to keep dependencies. It's a great choice for monorepo projects.

## 🔥 Bundler/Compiler

### 📍 Vite

**[Vite](https://vite.dev/)** is a build tool that aims to provide a **faster** and leaner development experience for **modern** web projects. If there is no any bottleneck in your project, Vite is the best choice for starter templates.

### 📍 SWC

[SWC](https://swc.rs/) is a super-fast **JavaScript/TypeScript** compiler written in **Rust**. It's a faster alternative to Babel and TypeScript compiler. Also, we can use SWC with Vite to speed up the development process.

Supported tools:

- [WASM](https://swc.rs/docs/usage/wasm)
- [React](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc)

> Currently, SWC is not supported by Vue. See issue [#12356](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/12356).

## 🧪 Testing

### 📍 Vitest

**[Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)** is a Vite powered **fast**, **lightweight**, and **minimal** testing framework. It's a great alternative to *Jest* and Mocha.

## ✅ Linter/Fomatter

### 📍 ESLint

**[ESLint](https://eslint.org/)** is a static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns found in JavaScript code. It's a great choice for modern web projects.
